# wx-icons
These SVG files show an example of how to use SVG sprites to combine many images into one compact file. The minified version of the SVG file is only 11KB and has the ability to display one of 25 weather icons in clear vector quality at any size.

Each icon can be used in an &lt;img&gt; tag as follows:

&lt;img src="wx-icons.svg#symbol"&gt;

where symbol is one of the following codes:

sunny
clear-night
pcloudy-day
pcloudy-night
mcloudy-day
mcloudy-night
cloudy
fog-day
fog-night
windy
showers
isoshowers-day
isoshowers-night
drizzle
rain
flurries
snow
heavysnow
isosnow-day
isosnow-night
mix
cold
storms
isostorms-day
isostorms-night

Each icon is composed of one of seven symbols (sun, moon, cloud, lightning bolt, raindrop, rain shower, snow flake). By repeating this symbols throughout the file, the amount of code needed is greatly reduced.

You may use these icons for free, but an attribution somewhere in your site would be greatly appreciated.
